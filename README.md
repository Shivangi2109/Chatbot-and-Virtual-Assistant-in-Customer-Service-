# ðŸ”¹ Project Title: Chatbot and Virtual Assistant in Customer Service<br/>

## ðŸ“Œ Objective:<br/>
To build a customer service chatbot capable of understanding user queries and providing relevant responses using deep learning and machine learning models.
This project demonstrates the design and development of an intelligent **Chatbot and Virtual Assistant** for customer service use cases. It leverages an **Encoder-Decoder LSTM** model for generating natural, human-like responses.

## ðŸ“š Overview

Customer support is a vital part of any service-based organization. This chatbot is capable of:
- Generating automated responses that are relevant and context-aware.

The model is trained on a dataset of chatbot and can be easily expanded to support more intents and scenarios.
